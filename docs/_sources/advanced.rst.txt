Configuration files
-------------------

mercure stores the configuration in multiple files in the subfolder /configuration. If you want to backup the configuration or install mercure on another machine, you need to copy all files inside this folder.

============== ================
File           Meaning
============== ================
bookkeeper.env Contains the IP, port, and DB password for the bookkeeper
mercure.json    Configured targets, rules, storage location, and other mercure settings
services.json  Customizable list of used mercure services
users.json     User information for the webgui
webgui.env     Contains the IP, port, and secret key for the webgui
============== ================


Additional settings
-------------------

Advanced settings can be reviewed and adjusted on the Configuration page of the webgui. To change the settings, click the "Edit Settings" button at the bottom of the page. Once saved, the different service modules will automatically load the updated configuration. 

.. important:: Make sure to preserve correct JSON formatting of the settings. The webgui will automatically check the syntax before saving the file.

Alternatively to using the webgui, the changes can also be made by directly editing the file mercure.json with a Linux text editor, e.g. nano.

.. important:: When editing the configuration file directly, it is required to shutdown all mercure services prior to making any changes (via the webgui or systemctl command).

The following settings can be customized (default values can be found in default_mercure.json):
